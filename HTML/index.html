            <h1>About Me</h1>
           <i> 
               <p>I’m Baxolise Qasana, a tech-driven professional with a strong foundation in Computer Science,
                     GIS, and Remote Sensing. My academic background includes a BSc in Computer Science and GIS,
                    along with an Honours degree specializing in Remote Sensing and GIS. This expertise,
                    combined with my experience as a Business Analyst Intern, has equipped me with 
                    a unique skill set that bridges analytical thinking with advanced technical knowledge.
                   Through my GIS research, where I utilized Java to estimate biomass on forest plantations,
                   I developed a problem-solving mindset and a passion for data-driven insights. My professional
                  interests now include API and backend development, with a keen focus on leadership roles that
                    promote innovation and impact.
      
                 Currently based in Cape Town, I’m actively pursuing opportunities in the tech and GIS fields, ready to bring both dedication and fresh perspectives to my next role.

    <h3>Project Title: Estimating above ground biomass in Forest Plantations</h3>
    <p>Estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forest plantations is crucial for understanding various ecological and environmental factors. It helps quantify the amount of carbon stored in trees, which plays a key role in climate change mitigation efforts. By assessing AGB, we can gain valuable insights into forest health, growth, and productivity, and detect early signs of environmental stress or disease. This data is also instrumental in making sustainable forest management decisions, such as determining optimal harvesting practices and ensuring long-term forest vitality. Additionally, AGB estimates are used to assess biodiversity and habitat quality, as richer biomass often correlates with more diverse ecosystems. Beyond ecological monitoring, AGB is vital for the forestry industry, aiding in resource estimation and guiding timber production. Through the use of remote sensing and GIS technologies, AGB can be measured on a large scale, making it easier to monitor forest conditions across vast areas with minimal fieldwork. This data also has applications in renewable energy, as biomass can serve as a sustainable energy source. Ultimately, estimating AGB enhances our understanding of how forests respond to climate change and informs global environmental modeling efforts.</p>
